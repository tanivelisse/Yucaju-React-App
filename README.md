# Yucaju App

### The idea

The idea for this app was created to provide a solution to the limited access to communication in the island of Puerto Rico caused by Hurricane Maria. This was a source of numerous problems. Among them the difficulty of contacting friends and family in the island, specially by la "diaspora"(Puerto Ricans that live outside of the island, mainly in the USA). Cellphone reception and data service, if available, was sporadic and required people to move by car to spots where they could find them. Social media post where a quick way to report, but this tools can get overcrowded with other news and information. With this app I hope to create a simple way to report your safety status in short time and for others to have access to it at any moment when they connect to the app. This way in a future event, while the communications systems go back to normal operations, there is a way to indicate safety to friends and family if you are unable to get in contact in other ways after the event of a Hurricane. 

### The name 

The name Yocajú comes from the Taíno deity by that name, that was belived to live in "El Yunke Rain Forest". According to the myth he faught against the goddess Guabancex, also known as Juaracán, who was resposible for the hurricanes in the island. Up to this day, it is known that when huricanes try to enter the island through the rainforest they divert north and the hurricanes impact on the island is reduced.
