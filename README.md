# Yucaju App

### The idea

The idea for this app was created to find a solution to the difficulty to communicate in the island of Puerto Rico during the aftermath of a Hurricane. After Hurricane Maria this was a source of numerous problems. Cellphone reception and data service, if available, was sporadic and required people to move by car to spots where they could find them. Social media post where a quick way to communicate, but this tools can get overcrowded with other news and information. All of this resulted in communities becoming their own first responders. With this app I hope to create a simple way for the user share the resources available with a description of it's location in their immediate community to facilitate the spread of important information. 

### The name 

The name Yocajú comes from the Taíno deity by that name, that was believed to live in "El Yunque Rain Forest". According to the myth he fought against the goddess Guabancex, also known as Juaracán, who was responsible for the hurricanes in the island. Up to this day, it is known that when the eye of a hurricane tries to enter the island through the rainforest's, it diverts north and the hurricane's impact on the island is reduced.

### User Stories

1. The main users of this app will be residents of Puerto Rico.
2. This app will allow Puerto Rico residents users to create, post, and find resources in their immediate "barrios" (neighborhoods).
3. The user will sign up previous to the hurricane emergency with username, password, name, municipality and barrio.
3. After sign-up/login the user will be redirected to his/hers/their profile page where he/she/they can create their resources post and click on the "all resources" button to access more resources in their neighborhood. 
 Users that are not residents of Puerto Rico will not register, but will be able to have access to the safety status reported by registered users.
